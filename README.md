# Schmooze

Schmooze lets Ruby and Node.js work together intimately. It has a DSL that allows you to define what methods you need, and it executes code by spawning a Node.js process and sending messages back and forth.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'schmooze'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install schmooze
